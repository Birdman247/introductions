            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>One of my main hobbies is camping. I really enjoy many outdoor activities like biking, fishing, and boating, so traveling to new and far away places is something that I love to do. This past year I went canoeing up in the boundary waters near the Canadian border. I had a ton of fun just following the map and the area, especially the sunsets, which were really beautiful</p>
